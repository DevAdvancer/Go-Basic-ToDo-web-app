# Basic Go web page 
<p>I just tried something new with Go, mostly for fun. I'm currently learning the basics of the syntax, but Go isn't my main language. :)</p>

<p>One personal suggestion: don't think Go is only good for routing. I would recommend using Go with React.js, Next.js, or other frameworks and libraries. However, I wouldn't recommend Go specifically for these.</p>

<p>Routing in Go is more complex than you might expect. It's much easier in other frameworks. However, it would be great if companies implemented it. :)</p>
