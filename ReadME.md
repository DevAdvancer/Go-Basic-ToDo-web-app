# Basic Go web page 
<p>Just tried something new with go this is just for time pass nothing like I am just learning basics of syntax and this is not my main language :)</p>

<p>One personal suggestion that don't think that go is only good for routing I will recommend that go for react js, next js and other framework or libraries Don't go for golang for this.</p>
<p>In go routing is very much complex than you think it is much more easier in other framework :) This is great for companies if they will implement :) </p>
